#📊 Power BI Dashboard Project
##📘 Project Description

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive, interactive dashboard designed to analyze key business performance indicators.
The report aims to help decision-makers quickly understand trends, identify operational bottlenecks, and monitor essential metrics.
The dataset used in this project includes structured business data containing categories such as transactions, dates, customer information, and performance metrics.

The dashboard includes two pages:

Main Dashboard – A high-level overview of all major KPIs and visuals.

Drill-Through Page – A detailed view allowing users to analyze specific items selected from the main page.

###🚀 Features & Capabilities

Interactive data visualizations using charts, cards, and tables

KPI tracking across multiple categories (e.g., revenue, performance trends, comparisons)

Drill-through insights for deeper analysis

Slicers and filters for dynamic exploration

Data transformations using Power Query

Logical calculations implemented with DAX measures

Automated data modeling and relationship management

Clean and intuitive layout focused on actionable insights

###📂 Dataset Details

The dataset was imported and transformed using Power Query. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning:

Removal of duplicates

Standardization of column formats

Type conversion of numeric, date, and text fields

Data Modeling:

Relationship creation between fact and dimension tables

Normalization of repeated fields

DAX Measures:

Custom KPIs such as totals, averages, YOY changes, and conditional metrics

Calculated columns for categorization and segmentation

Data sources may include structured CSV, Excel, or database exports (depending on the version of the project uploaded).
